Hello,

This is a simple python program that works as a Key Logger. It logs every key pressed by user on keyboard.

Important Features:
    1. It waits for 5 seconds, If user doesn't press any key, it logs the previously pressed keys.
    2. It takes care of special keys like backspace and remove the previos key preessed.
    3. It formats the keys according to keys pressed by user. For now, it handles "Enter", "Backspace" and "SpaceBar".

Thanks.
